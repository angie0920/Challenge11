## Usage

Search trend and stock price behavior during 2020 is examined. Stock volatility is then visualized. Then a correlation table of stock volatility, hourly stock return, and lagged search trends is generated. Lastly, the user generates a time series model that analyzes and forecasts patterns in the hourly search data. Below are screenshots of these activities:
